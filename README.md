# JUS4330-Social-Justice-Data-Science-Module
This is a repository containing the material regarding data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's [Center for Applied Data Science (CADS)](https://www.wssu.edu/academics/colleges-and-departments/college-of-arts-sciences-business-education/center-for-applied-data-science/index.html) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions.

# Social Justice
This repository contains the data science infusion adopter modules of a course in Social Justice as taught by Dr. Jack S. Monell. This Social Justice course is offered once a year in the Spring at Winston-Salem State University. The course is primarily intended for upper level/seniors majoring in Justice Studies. 

The focus of the course is investigating the landscape of critical social issues including: poverty, income inequality, hunger, welfare, homelessness, human rights, race, gender, age and disability discrimnation, crime, unjust and unequal sentencing, and violation of civil rights and liberties.

# Learning Outcomes
* Students will evaluate competing approaches to approaching and analyzing data concerning social issues accross the U.S.
* Through such analysis, students will then be able to conceptualize or formulate possible solutions to those issues

# Data Science Infusion
The primary focus of this repository concerns only the portion of the course where the data science infusion modules were implemented as part of the CADS adopter program. The modules were classified into two broad areas:
